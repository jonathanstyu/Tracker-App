##JumpShot - A Basketball Tracking App

Jumpshot is a basketball tracking app written in RubyMotion. I had written it before joining AppAcademy and focused on understanding and learning as much as I possibly could about the iOS APIs, design, and general coding. It has a number of features: 

* It allows you to add individual players to a team
* It uses a NIB built in xCode to create a colorful, intuitive way to track players' stats. 
* Players can manage preferences to account for 1 or 2 point baskets and three-pointers
* There is a box score after a game is over
* You can track an individual player's performances with a player profile

JumpShot relies on a number of cool Cocoapods and RubyMotion gems to do its work. These include:

Cocoapods 
* NanoStore
* AKTabBarController
* SVPulltoRefresh
* MCSwipeTableViewCell

RubyMotion Gems
* Bubble-wrap
* SugarCube
* Geomotion
